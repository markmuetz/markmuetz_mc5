% Stress physically justifiable
% Point out links/deps between hi-res <=> p'trized
With Monitoring Committee V comes the extra requirement of detailed planning of the rest of my PhD. This is a useful exercise in its own right, and focuses my mind on the tasks of generating the results and writing up my thesis. It is also a good time to take stock and think about what I have done to date, how to bring this together into a coherent thesis and what gaps there might be in this thesis.

I started out getting up-to-speed with meteorology and numerical modelling, completing 6 assessed modules. This was followed by learning about the fields of convective parametrization and high-resolution modelling, putting into practice a lot of what I learnt by running the idealized UM (iUM). In phase 0 of my PhD plan, the goal was to make sure that the iUM was capable of being used for what we wanted to do; this has been done but took longer than expected due to the moisture conservation issues highlighted in previous MCs. Subsequent work, leading up to the companion paper for MC IV, built on learning how to use the iUM and on understanding and managing its flaws for high-resolution modelling. I also spent time reading up on the organization of convection, in the atmosphere in the form of squall lines, and in models in the form of squall lines, and through the mechanism of self-aggregation.

To indicate how I will turn this work into a thesis, it is useful to set out the logical line of argument of my thesis. The goal remains to represent shear-induced organization of convection in a convective parametrization scheme, ideally in a way that is scale-aware. The line of argument starts by recognizing that shear can have an organizing effect on cloud fields. By looking at the range of wind profiles generated in coarse-resolution models, I will build a number of Representative Wind Profiles (RWPs), that reduce the parameter space to something manageable. The second strand is to use high-resolution models to investigate how shear-induced organization affects key aspects of the cloud field, for example the lifetime of the convection, the vertical momentum transports and the statistics of mass flux in the cloud field. This information, coupled with a diagnosis of which RWP a given grid-column is in, can then be used to modify the convective parametrization scheme in the coarse-resolution model.

There are still blanks to be filled in in the remaining part of my PhD. How to generate the RWPs? I have done some experimental work to classify these profiles using a machine learning technique, but this needs to be extended and the analysis checked more thoroughly (see section XXX). How to modify the convective parametrization? We have some ideas how this could work (see section XXX), but these will need to be tested. 

Overall, I am pleased with how my PhD is going. Although I have not accomplished all the things laid out in last MC report's ``Future work'' section, I believe I have done an equivalent amount of work. My placement at the Met Office meant that it was sensible to re-arrange the order in which I carried out my PhD plan, looking into how I might go about modifying a convective parametrization scheme before carrying out some of the high-resolution modelling. Finding a potential way of reducing the parameter space of the shear profiles also means that the high-resolution modelling has been pushed further back in my updated plan.

To start to get to grips with some work looking at wind profile and shear climatologies, I read \cite{houchi2010comparison}. They look into the zonal and meridional profiles of $u$ and $\frac{du}{dz}$ in both radiosonde observations and ECMWF \SI{12}{hr} forecasts. Although the motivation of the work is different from mine, they are interested in using the ECMWF forecasts to model how a satellite will perform, some of the ideas may be useful and it is something to compare against. However, they were looking at comparisons between colocated observations and interpolated model output, and they were interested in a larger depth of atmosphere, from the surface to \SI{35}{km}.

In \cite{mapes2011parameterizing}, they look at the link between entrainment as formulated in a convective parametrization and the behaviour of the model. They identify the ``entrainment dilemma'', whereby a value of the entrainment rate that is too high leads to a model that is unstable to explicit convection. Conversely, an entrainment rate that is too low leads to too much deep convection, and a corresponding deterioration of the space and time distributions and variability. To ameliorate this situation, the develop a 2D dimensionless prognostic \textit{org} that represents then subgrid organization of a given grid-column. Rain evaporation is taken as a source or \textit{org}, which can be advected horizontally. \textit{org} acts to reduce the entrainment rate in a grid-column, thereby acting as a time-lagged positive feedback on the parametrized convection. 

\cite{willett2017simple} take a similar approach. They again change the entrainment rate through a new prognostic variable. This time it is a 3D prognostic variable, which they argue makes it simpler to advect around as there is not need to work out an effective steering level as in \cite{mapes2011parameterizing}. The source of the prognostic is taken as being the precipitation, as this is related to the strength of the convection.

Finally, a look at \cite{tompkins2017organization} examines entrainment affects organization from a different perspective - that of a Cloud Resolving Model (CRM). In my project, I am aiming to link entrainment in the convective parametrization to results from a CRM, so this serves as an introduction to some of the concepts involved. ...

\section{Completed work}
\label{sec:Completed work}

\subsection{Progress overview}
\label{sec:Progress overview}

In terms of sticking to the work laid out in the last MC, I have made good progress on cloud tracking, doing all the work presented here at \SI{1}{km} resolution (Section \ref{sec:Cloud tracking}). I worked on reducing the spin-up time by using lower-resolution profiles of $\theta$ and water vapour, work which will be even more useful in terms of saving computation time at higher resolution. I have not done more work at \SI{250}{m} resolution yet, nor have I run a stochastic parametrization scheme in either idealized or global simulations. Instead, I laid the foundations for other parts of my PhD with the shear classification work and making modifications to the \cite{gregory1990mass} scheme as set out in Sections \ref{sec:Classification of shear profiles} and \ref{sec:um_mod}.

\subsection{Cloud tracking}
\label{sec:Cloud tracking}

From analysing cloud tracks, useful information can be gleaned on e.g. cloud lifetimes that I might be able to use to modify a convective parametrization scheme. The cloud tracking used here uses an approach that is a combination of Juwon Kim's cloud tracking and the method of \cite{plant2009statistical}. 
%The reason that I chose not to use Juwon's work without modification was that it was developed for a different reason - tracking clouds in real world situations with a changing wind vector across the domain (my idealized work used a constant wind over the domain). \cite{plant2009statistical} method was integrated directly into the model, this was not possible for me although the bulk of the ideas come from this method. 
The method works by comparing two snapshots of the cloud field at a given height a certain time apart, in my case I use \SI{2}{km} and \SI{5}{min}. To calculate overlaps, the maximum correlation vector between the two fields is calculated, and this is used to project the cloud field at the first snapshot to where it would be moved to by the time of the second snapshot. This idea and code was taken from Juwon's method. Then the method of \cite{plant2009statistical} is applied, working out the number of merges and splits and handling edge cases such as when two clouds split and merge into two separate clouds (see Figure \todo{XXX}).

I then applied this method to data from the last \todo{XXX} days from a \SI{1}{km} resolution run, the results from the no shear and strong shear experiments (S0 and S4) are presented in Figure \ref{fig:cloud_lifetimes}. 
The distribution is bimodal, with the first mode showing a large number of short-lived clouds. The second mode peaks at a lifetime of around \SI{50}{min}. 
The results from S0 for all cloud lifetimes are in line with previous modelling work \cite{plant2008stochastic} and observations \todo{cite}.

The distribution can be further analysed by splitting it into simple and complex lifetimes - lifetimes that contain no merges or splits and those that do. The complex lifetimes distribution for S0 is shown in subfigure \ref{fig:cloud_lifetimes} (b), where it is seen that complex lifetimes are longer than all lifetimes, and there are far fewer with very short lifetimes. 

Comparing the equivalent subfigures for S4, two main points jump out. The first is that the number of short-lived clouds for all lifetimes is increased. Speculatively, this could be due to enhanced shear above the boundary layer increasing entrainment and therefor decreasing cloud lifetime. The second is that for S4, the distribution is shifted towards longer lifetimes. The mean lifetime for these clouds is \todo{XXX}, whereas for S0 it is \todo{XXX}.
